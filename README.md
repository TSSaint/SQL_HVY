Trying to learn more about databases and why we need them.

### Ah, Databases
Database: A collection of structured data or an abstract representation of some element.
<br>
Data is ubiquitous - everything is store somewhere.<br>
In our modern superconnected world, almost everything is stored in some kind of database. This is a practice that is growing more than we can imagine by almost all companies in all industries.

## Moore's Law
Thinking:<br>
Predicted that the number of chips on an integrated curcuit board doubles almost every two years. Proving true for many decades, this prediction has more or less defined the growth and explosion of various technologies. Think room-sized computers being thousands of times less powerful than today's pocket-sized smartphones.<br>

## Today
We are looking up information all the time - this makes us very powerful and omniscient in a way.
Since we're online all the time, everything we are doing is recorded. Companies use this data to basically improve our lives (without us asking, or asking for it). This isn't as intrusive as we can imagine, but it pretty much touches all aspects of our lives. Either way, it is pretty incredible considering the relatively recent history of computers.<br>

## Everything is a Signal and Can Be Analyzed
Most people conduct their lives online. As a result, every click, view, and action can be viewed as a signal. If you can analyze these things, you might even be able to build and create something really cool - and profitable (think Facebook, Google, Snapchat)!<br>
Since most of these things are analyzed, it requires a lot of computing power and good old human intelligence. Such aspects are actually useful for companies - and for users. From this...

## 40000 Exobytes
From 2010 to 2020, approximately 50x amount of the data is being stored and tracked from 800 to 40,000 Exobytes.<br>
An Exobyte is bout 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes. 40,000 of them is an unimaginably high number.<br>
Considering this, you can imagine why it's so scale greate informational databases, and also why it is so important to store and understand data.

## How..?
How do we store data?<br>
How do we get insights?<br>
How do we update it?<br>
How can we query it?<br>
How do we ensure data is not corrupted?<br>
How can we do it quickly?<br>

## Data-Driven Business Decisions
The key to figuring out trends and the future lies in understanding and making use of data!<br>
If used well, data can give you insights and ideas that can improve your experiences - and even make business more profitable.

## The Key to Learning: Simple Relational Databases
Having been around for a very long time, these datasets are more important than ever. Large data sets are stored using relational databases, even today (think ecommerce, social networking, and finance, etc.).

## Why Do We Need Databases?
Some amazing systems need databases.<br>
Consider an Order Management System in an E-Commerce Site:<br>
These keep track of inventory, know if items are available, where things need to be delivered, and what the status of shipments are.<br>
The status of an order can change from packaged, to shipped, to delivered, to returned, or even lost! All this information is stored for a LIFETIME.
<br> This information can be used to power personalized searches and recommendations, which caters to people's needs and an improved UX.<br> 
Let's say Joe wants to buy a TV. He goes onto some e-commerce site to purchase a TV. An order management system needs to check if the TV is available, Joe's name, address, and even phone number. bank account details, and etc. Even the TV will have it's own dataset, such as description, model unit, date shipped, et cetera.<br>
To have something shipped to Joe, lots of data needs to be processed under one system.<br>

## Systems Need to Work Correctly
We need to implement repetitive and efficient logical systems in our databases/programs. For example, when an e-commerce system SELLS an item, it's overall inventory of SAID ITEM is reduced by one. Since we want things to work perfectly, they must be well maintained and accurate.
<br>

## Systems/Data Must Last Forever and Never Lose Information
Because of the importance of having data and using it, it is important to never lose information.. EVER. IT should be secure, can be recovered, and constantly backed up in case of failures. All of these things are extremely important for things such as security and historical understanding.

## Data Storage Requirement Checks
Some things to consider are the following. Storage requirement checks are incredibly important to databases because they must be as perfect and accessible as possible.<br>
- Correctness
- Validity
- Security
- Durablility
- Recoverability
- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Concurrency
- Integrity

## Validity Checking is Important
Data should be related and closely tied to the systems that use them. Any time we try to reproduce some data or refer to different systems for storage and checking we are prone to annoying or terrible errors.<br>

# DBMS
Database Management Systems contain all kinds of checks and important structuring of data systems. They are complex pieces of software that mediates access to data - an incredibly crucial and important aspect for modern programs and systems. They guarantee many properties by DBMS'.
