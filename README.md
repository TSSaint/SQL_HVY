Trying to learn more about databases and why we need them.

### Ah, Databases
Data is ubiquitous - everything is store somewhere.<br>
In our modern superconnected world, almost everything is stored in some kind of database. This is a practice that is growing more than we can imagine by almost all companies in all industries.

## Moore's Law
Thinking:<br>
Predicted that the number of chips on an integrated curcuit board doubles almost every two years. Proving true for many decades, this prediction has more or less defined the growth and explosion of various technologies. Think room-sized computers being thousands of times less powerful than today's pocket-sized smartphones.<br>

## Today
We are looking up information all the time - this makes us very powerful and omniscient in a way.
Since we're online all the time, everything we are doing is recorded. Companies use this data to basically improve our lives (without us asking, or asking for it). This isn't as intrusive as we can imagine, but it pretty much touches all aspects of our lives. Either way, it is pretty incredible considering the relatively recent history of computers.<br>

## Everything is a Signal and Can Be Analyzed
Most people conduct their lives online. As a result, every click, view, and action can be viewed as a signal. If you can analyze these things, you might even be able to build and create something really cool - and profitable (think Facebook, Google, Snapchat)!<br>
Since most of these things are analyzed, it requires a lot of computing power and good old human intelligence. Such aspects are actually useful for companies - and for users. From this...

## 40000 Exobytes
From 2010 to 2020, approximately 50x amount of the data is being stored and tracked from 800 to 40,000 Exobytes.<br>
An Exobyte is bout 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes. 40,000 of them is an unimaginably high number.<br>
Considering this, you can imagine why it's so scale greate informational databases, and also why it is so important to store and understand data.

## How..?
How do we store data?<br>
How do we get insights?<br>
How do we update it?<br>
How can we query it?<br>
How do we ensure data is not corrupted?<br>
How can we do it quickly?<br>

## Data-Driven Business Decisions
The key to figuring out trends and the future lies in understanding and making use of data!
